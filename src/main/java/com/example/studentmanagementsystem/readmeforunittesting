Unit testing or Component testing is a software testing techie in which single component of software is tested.
The objective here is to pick each unit(code) and verify it.

Mocking refers to the development of objects which are mock or clone of real objects.
In this technique mock object is used instead of real objects for testing
Mock object give a particular output for each particular input
Mockito is the most popular framework used for mocking
    Mockito is a java based framework used for unit testing of java applications
    This mocking framework helps in development of testable applications
    Java Reflection API used internally to generate mock objects
    Mockito is used to simplify the test development by mocking external dependencies and using them in the code
    When a component is to be tested, but that component depends on some other component, which is under development
    When the real components performs slowly, then mock objects are used to perform testing
    When there are any concerns with the infrastructure that makes the testing impossible

Stub
Stub are objects holding predefined data and uses the data to give responses during the tests.
It can be refereed to as object that looks like a real object with least number of methods
Stubs return the predefined outputs no matter what the input is.
These stubs are used to reduce complexities that occur while creating the real objects
